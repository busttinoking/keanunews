## Keanu Reeves Introduces The World To His First Girlfriend In 20 Years

_The Actor has never appeared with a pair on a red carpet in 35 years of career; (his previous relationship had a tragic outcome)_

Very Discreet, actor Keanu Reeves, 55, publicly took over dating 46-year-old artist Alexandra Grant. The two paraded hand in hand on the red carpet of a Gucci designer event that took place on Saturday 2 in Los Angeles, California. According to the Daily Mail, the couple arrived at the event and did not hang out – as they posed for photos, exchanged caresses and passionate glances in front of the photographers.

Still according to the newspaper, in 35 years of career, franchise star Matrix and John Wick never posed with a girlfriend on the red carpet of an event.

The actor’s last official relationship was in 1999 with actress Jennifer Syme. The couple met while Jennifer was an assistant to filmmaker David Lynch and, according to Reeves, fell in love instantly. The relationship, however, had a tragic end. On Christmas Eve 1999, while the actor was recording Matrix, the couple’s daughter, Ava, was born dead at 8 months of gestation. Due to the grief, the relationship ended, but the two remained friends until Jennifer was killed in a car accident in 2001 at 28 years of age.

Photographed while leaving a restaurant in September, the couple have known each other for a long time. Alexandra, who in addition to a renowned plastic artist is also a painter, sculptor and filmmaker, produced the covers and all visual art of two Reeves poetry books: Ode To Happiness (2011) and Shadows (2015). The American press, however, saw the couple only as good friends until then.

On Twitter, the actor and his girlfriend became the hot topic. The network’s users, accustomed to gray-haired huts parading alongside women half their age, praised the couple: she, although younger, has long white hair.
